        <h1>Emergency Aid: Sylhet Flood</h1>
        <p>
          Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years.
          Thousands of children are at risk, threatened by a high risk of
          drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are
          crowded into emergency flood shelters. Families and children are
          trapped at home waiting for boats to bring relief. Roads and homes
          have been submerged, power stations are down, and over 380 schools
          have been closed or impacted.
